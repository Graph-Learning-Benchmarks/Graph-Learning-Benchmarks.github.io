# Overview

This workshop aims to initiate an effort to mitigate the lack of quantity and diversity of graph benchmarks through crowdsourcing in the graph machine learning community. 

Graph-structured data are ubiquitous, heterogeneous, and diverse in real world applications. While recent literature has demonstrated that graph machine learning models---especially graph neural networks (GNNs)---achieve promising performance on a variety of  tasks, there is a trend that further improvements on particular tasks often face dramatically different technical bottlenecks. 

Despite the clear heterogeneity of graph machine learning tasks and their associated technical challenges, there lack enough quantity and diversity of benchmark tasks and datasets reflecting the rich heterogeneity. The lack of benchmarks not only hinders the community's progress in finding the synergy among the variety of models, it may even bias the development of new models towards narrow directions.

Inspired by the well-established conference tracks in computer vision and natural language processing communities that are dedicated to establish new benchmark datasets and tasks, we call for contributions by establishing novel machine learning tasks on novel graph-structured data which have the potential to provide benchmark evaluations for various graph neural network models. The acceptance of the contributed papers will be decided on the meaningfulness of the established graph learning tasks/datasets and their potential of being formalized into new benchmarks, rather than the performance of machine learning models (old or new) on these tasks. We particularly welcome contributions of negative results of popular, state-of-the-art models on a new task/dataset, as these provide novel insights to the community's understanding of the meta-knowledge of graph machine learning.
